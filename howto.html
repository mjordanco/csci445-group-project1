	<p>Welcome to our game of bullseye, where the goal is to get the highest score. The target gets faster and more difficult to hit as your score increases, so be careful! </p>
	<dl> 
		<dt class="first"> 1) Shoot the target!</dt>
			<dd>Click the left mouse button in order to shoot the target</dd>
		<dt class="first"> 2) You can only miss the target four times in a row</dt>
			<dd>On the fifth miss in a row, you lose one of your lives and your consecutive miss count represented by the red circles on the right side of the screen is reset. Even if you miss the target four times in a row, you still have the chance to save yourself! Hitting the target even once resets your miss count to zero, and all of the red circles on the side of the screen should disappear.</dd>
		<dt class="first"> 3) Be careful- you only have 3 lives!</dt>
				<dd>When the number of red circles on the right side of the screen gets to five, you lose a life and the red warning circles are reset. The green mushrooms in the lower right corner of the screen represent your lives- and you only get three!</dd>
